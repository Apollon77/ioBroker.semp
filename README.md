**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** 
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.
